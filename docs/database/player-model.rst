Player Model
============

Stats
-----
General idea is to stick with runs/wins as the primary unit of measurement. All stats shouldn't be counters, they should be averaged and weighted. Counters should only be used to permit the stats as statistically relevant. Common stats such as batting average, era, and more traditional stats should all be weighted in the current season. However, stats that don't have as much as a history might not be possible to be accurately weighted per season.

The simulator will allow the user to weight other stats differently but the goal will be to have defaults with the best accuracy.

My Focus
~~~~~~~~
These are the stats my initial thoughts are to focus on and weigh the most heavily.

Offensive
^^^^^^^^^
Qualifiers
   Plate Appearances

* Runs created per 27 outs
* Batting average (weighted per season)
* On base percentage (weighted per season)

Pitching
^^^^^^^^
Qualifiers
   Innings Pitched (Differentiate starters and relievers)

* ERA (weighted per season)
* Defensive independent ERA 
* Batting on balls in play

Defensive
^^^^^^^^^
Qualifiers
   Innings

* dWAR


Non Statistical Based Measurements
----------------------------------
Analyzing prospects (domestic & international) will be one of the most difficult parts to build on the database. It will based on a lot of different baseball analysts top prospect lists. 

Obvious
~~~~~~~
* Position on top ranking lists 
* Scouting power rankings (difficult to analyze many different sites have different definitations for this)
* High school stats **difficult to acquire**
* Analyze bio, height, etc when predicting. 

Ideas
~~~~~
* Mainting the movement a player undergoes on top lists
