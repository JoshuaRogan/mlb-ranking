Corey Seager, the No. 1 prospect in Keith Law’s 2016 preseason rankings of major league prospects, punctuated the Los Angeles Dodgers’ 5-0 win over the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday with a three-run home run.

The teams resume their four-game series tonight (8 p.m. ET, ESPN/WatchESPN), and ahead of the game, we take a look at Seager’s accomplishments in his brief major league career.

Seager made his major league debut Sept. 3, 2015, and had 98 at-bats last season. Wednesday’s game will be the 80th of his career. Since his debut, Seager ranks in the top four among players whose primary position is shortstop in batting average, slugging percentage, home runs and runs batted in (min. 200 PA).

Among players with at least 300 plate appearances since the start of last season, Seager is one of nine with a triple-slash line of at least .290/.360/.500 in that time. You’ve probably heard of the others: Bryce Harper, Mike Trout, Nelson Cruz, Paul Goldschmidt, Miguel Cabrera, Manny Machado, Ryan Braun and David Peralta.

Seager leads the Dodgers with 58 hits this season. No rookie has finished a season leading the Dodgers in hits since Raul Mondesi in 1994.

Sibling similarities

Looking at the time since Seager’s promotion from the minor leagues, his stats compare to those of his older brother, Seattle Mariners third baseman Kyle Seager.

Corey Seager’s .296 batting average is 21 points better than his brother’s in that span. The younger Seager has a nine-point edge in on-base percentage (.364 to .355). Kyle Seager has the advantage in slugging percentage (.510 to .502). They’re virtually even in OPS. Both round off to .865. Corey Seager’s OPS is .000168 better.

Corey Seager is a hair ahead in hard-hit rate (20.1 percent to 19.7 percent). The two rank 17th and 19th in the majors in that stat over that span.

From May 7 to the present, Seager is slugging .569 with seven home runs in 24 games. But he has struck out more and walked a lot less.

Seager has improved against offspeed pitches, whiffing less and hitting three home runs against offspeed pitches since May 7 (he had one through May 6).

He also improved against pitches in the upper half of the strike zone in May. He hit .188 with six hits against pitches to that area in April but was at .351 with 13 hits in May.

Cubs notes

Offense, pitching, defense -- the Cubs are doing it all this season. They rank third in the majors with 5.5 runs per game and are first in ERA (2.65) and defensive runs saved (34).

The Cubs turn 73 percent of balls in play against their defense into outs, which is the best percentage in baseball.

On offense, they have walked in 11.8 percent of their plate appearances, which would be the highest walk percentage by a team since the 2000 Mariners walked in 12.0 percent of their plate appearances. Cubs batters chase 25 percent of pitches out of the strike zone, the fewest in the major leagues.
