Texas A&M entered the NCAA tournament as the top-ranked team in the country, and the Aggies also lead all teams with four players on our three All-America teams. First-teamers Ryne Birk and Boomer White, the Southeastern Conference player of the year, lead the group.

The SEC put a total of 11 players on the teams, second only to the Atlantic Coast Conference. Ten ACC teams advanced to the NCAA tournament, the most of any conference, and that talent was also reflected with 13 All-Americans. Both of the last two ACC players of the year—2016 honoree Seth Beer and 2015’s winner Will Craig—are first-team All-Americans.

In additon to Texas A&M, six other schools produced multiple All-Americans. Clemson, Louisville and Virginia, the defending national champions, all had three players honored. Florida, Mississippi State and Oklahoma State all landed two players on the teams. In all, 33 schools are represented on the All-America teams.

Two players from the Preseason All-America first team also made the postseason first team: Kyle Lewis and Logan Shore. Three others were on the second team in the preseason: Zack Collins, Eric Lauer and Brendan McKay, the 2015 Freshman of the Year. In all, 10 players who made one of the Preseason All-America teams are again honored on the postseason teams.

C ZACK COLLINS JR. MIAMI

The 2014 Freshman of the Year, Collins put together his best offensive and defensive season this spring for the Hurricanes, batting .364/.540/.630 with 12 home runs to lead Miami to the third overall seed in the NCAA tournament. Collins’ behind-the-plate defense also took a noticeable jump—elevating his draft stock.

1B ERIC GUTIERREZ SR. TEXAS TECH

A two-time participant in the college home run derby in Omaha, Guiterrez has tremendous power and showcased it this season with 12 home runs and a .344/.468/.621 line. The senior—who has started and played in every game of his college career—was a large reason why the powerful Red Raiders ran away with the Big 12 Conference.

2B RYNE BIRK JR. TEXAS A&M

It isn’t easy to stand out in a lineup as deep and balanced as Texas A&M’s, but Birk was a consistent contributor for the Aggies this spring, batting in multiple spots in the order, including cleanup. He hit .318/.375/.494 with seven home runs for Texas A&M, providing some offensive juice from the second base position.

3B BOOMER WHITE JR. TEXAS A&M

texasaandm
The SEC player of the year’s numbers—on first blush—are impressive. He hit .395/.471/.524 with four home runs. It’s a gaudy stat line. But then look at the conference-only numbers: .471/.524/.653 with three home runs. SEC pitchers simply couldn’t get White out all season long. That’s not an easy feat in the SEC.

SS TAYLOR WALLS SO. FLORIDA STATE

Florida-State
After cooling off in the second half of last season, the sophomore blossomed this year, batting .357/.480/.518 with six home runs and 14 stolen bases in 15 attempts. FSU’s leadoff hitter, Walls epitomized the Seminoles’ patient, grind-it-out offensive approach, putting up a stunning .508 on-base percentage in ACC play.

OF SETH BEER FR. CLEMSON

Clemson
After graduating from high school a semester early and enrolling at Clemson in January, Beer took college baseball by storm, winning ACC player of the year honors. He went on a 26-game hitting streak, the fourth-longest in program history, and went into the NCAA Tournament hitting .372/.532/.686 with 16 home runs.

OF ANFERNEE GRIER JR. AUBURN

auburn
Grier was a bright spot in a long season for Auburn, as the team struggled through a tumultuous transition following Sunny Golloway’s firing in October. He hit .366/.457/.576 with 12 home runs and 19 stolen bases in 238 at-bas, in addition to playing exceptional defense for the Tigers in center field.

OF KYLE LEWIS JR. MERCER

mercerbaseball
The 2015 Southern Conference player of the year repeated that performance this spring, as he led Mercer to the regular season championship—and won BA’s College Player of the Year award. He hit .395/.535/.731 with 20 home runs and was leading the nation with 66 walks going into the NCAA Tournament.

DH WILL CRAIG JR. WAKE FOREST

wake-forest
Craig blew up last year with one of the loudest offensive performances in the country. He improved on that this year, batting .392/.537/.766 with 16 home runs and 65 RBIs, while serving as the team’s primary closer. Craig led the nation in slugging and was among the national leaders in most other categories.

UT BRENDAN MCKAY SO. LOUISVILLE

louisville
McKay won Freshman of the Year last year for a stellar year as Louisville’s Saturday starter and cleanup hitter. Still batting cleanup (.330/.416/.498, four home runs), McKay moved to the Friday role this spring and was one of the best starters in the ACC yet again, going 11-3, 2.25 and using his power curve to strike out 109 in 96 innings.

SP ERIC LAUER JR. KENT STATE

KentState
Lauer didn’t give up a run in his final four starts of his junior season and gave up just 15 (eight earned) in his first 11 starts. That kind of dominance led him to go 10-2, 0.69 for the season, with 125 strikeouts in 104 innings. His ERA is not only the best in the nation this year, but also the best for any Division I starting pitcher since 1979.

SP A.J. PUCKETT JR. PEPPERDINE

pepperdine
In one of the most dominant runs in NCAA history, Puckett threw 45⅔ consecutive scoreless innings for the Waves, the third-longest streak in modern college baseball history. Even after the streak ended, scoring against Puckett remained rare, and he went 9-3, 1.27, posting the third-best ERA in West Coast Conference history.

SP CODY SEDLOCK JR. ILLINOIS

Illinois
Sedlock made it two years in a row that Illinois has had the Big Ten Conference pitcher of the year, as he followed in Tyler Jay’s footsteps to win the award. Sedlock was a workhorse for Illinois, throwing two complete games and twice pitching past the ninth inning on the way to a 2.49 ERA. He set a program record with 116 strikeouts in 101 innings.

SP LOGAN SHORE JR. FLORIDA

Florida
Shore has been the Gators’ Friday starter since his freshman year, and he more than looked the part as a junior, even with teammates with bigger stuff. The Preseason All-American lived up to his billing, and went 10-0, 2.41 for the team that was ranked No. 1 most of the season. He was named Southeastern Conference pitcher of the year.

RP TROY RALLINGS SR. WASHINGTON

Washington
The key to Washington’s pitching staff this season was Rallings, who locked down the back end of games and served as his own middle relief. Only one of the senior’s 16 saves was of three outs or less. He accrued enough innings to qualify for the ERA title, and his mark of 0.89 led the Pac-12 Conference and ranked second nationally.
